# OffshoreLibraryC

This library contains all the functions used for modeling a Wind Farm using the software PSCAD
Inside the OFFSHORE folder, there are all the .c files including the .h header that contains all of the headers that are being used in this library.

Once the library is compiled, it is created a static library (.a file) in the tree: Offshore > bin > Debug

This .a file will be used on PSCAD simulations, for example.
